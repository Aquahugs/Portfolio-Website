                <p>4 Year Bachelors degree from CCS in Transportation
                Design located in Detroit,Michigan. I mainly focused on how to  think beyond traditional
                transportation modes and models, to design not only vehicles
                but entire systems that can evolve urban mobility from its
                current auto-dependent, monolithic state to something much more
                dynamic, diverse, and sustainable.</p>

                <p>Lived in Seoul Korea where I experienced a different culture
                and perspective on design as a whole. During my studies I would
                go to class from 10am-7pm that would mainly consist of 2D sketch
                and rendering practices.</p>

                <p>At Honda Research & Development America I explored the design

                 Worked Mainly on production interior components

                that the space  provided a deeper understanding of global
                research, future trends, environmental awareness and the
                opportunity to understand how transportation will impact
                our economy in the coming years.</p>

                      <p>
                    I believe every great experience is born from a compelling
                    story. Iâ€™ve always tried to seek a good balance between technicality
                     and simplicity through design.<br/>

                     During my freetime these days I like to learn about
                     decentralized applications and play Hearthstone. Currently
                     working at Honda Advanced Design, Im always eager to expand
                      my knowledge in all fields.<br/>
